# Every case runs against a REAL git repository with real commits. A fixture the
# test writes itself would only prove the script agrees with the test's own idea
# of a diff; these prove it agrees with git.
#
# Exit 0 means SKIP the build, exit 1 means BUILD it.
#
# The suite ends with a mutation: the catch-all that classifies unknown paths as
# deployable is deleted, the deletion is confirmed to have landed at the intended
# site, and the mutant is required to misbehave. A guard whose removal changes
# nothing was never guarding.
